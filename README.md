  - This software will be tested on an iPad4,1 (iPad Air1) running iOS 12.5, jailbroken using unc0ver.

# Project Description
Upon entering a user's name or a location, the program will attempt to get weather information, as well as recent Covid-19 statistics to determine whether it is safe to go outdoors or not.

A few bells and whistles may also be added, but no promises ü§û.

# Dependencies
This project aims to use the following dependencies
 - Requests
 - python-mysql-connector

This list is not complete, and will be expanded depending on changes to the script(s) and their implementation.

# So what can it do as of now?
