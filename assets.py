Features in mind:
    - covid info
    - weather info
    - easter egg (hopefully)
    - translation using googletrans
    - test connection speed
    - total rundown of system info (additional feature that is totally useless, but cool nonetheless)
    - joke at the end ----------- (groundwork has been laid)
    - make a database with a table for name-location for weather and covid info,
        and a table for name-language for translation
